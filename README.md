# Ollama Router: Open-Source LLM Tool Routing with Python

Welcome to **Ollama Router**, an open-source Python project that demonstrates how to build a tool-enabled LLM router using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and custom Python functions. This project shows how to connect LLMs to external tools (like weather and email), route user queries to the right tool, and maintain a secure, controlled workflow ‚Äî all running locally and fully open source.

## üöÄ Features

- **LLM Tool Routing**: Automatically detects user intent and routes requests to the appropriate tool (e.g., get weather, send email).
- **Ollama Integration**: Uses Ollama to run open-source LLMs locally ‚Äî no data leaves your machine.
- **Custom Tools**: Includes Python implementations for sending emails and fetching weather data.
- **Security-Focused Prompting**: Enforces strict tool activation protocols and input validation.
- **Extensible**: Easily add new tools or models.
